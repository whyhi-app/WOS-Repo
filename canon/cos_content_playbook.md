## SECTION A: WRITING FORMULAS

These are proven structures for generating high-quality social content. Content Drafter should reference these when creating posts.

---

### Formula 1: Use Case Spotlight

**Structure:**
1. Set the scene (specific, relatable situation)
2. Show the friction (what goes wrong with current tools)
3. Reveal WhyHi solution (natural, not forced)
4. Land the insight (why this matters)

**When to Use:**
- When you have a concrete scenario from Use Case Library
- For Instagram/Facebook (visual storytelling)
- When demonstrating value without explaining features

**Example:**

"You're locked out of your friend's apartment. You need to ask where the spare key is. You're not going to text back and forth for 10 minutes—you need an answer NOW. So you call.

But your friend forgot you were coming. They see your call and think, 'Oh no, what's wrong? Do I have time for this?' So they don't pick up.

With WhyHi, you'd send a 5-minute 'Question' call. Your friend sees exactly what you need. They pick up. Problem solved in 2 minutes.

Once you experience this, you realize: every call should work this way."

**Formula Elements:**
- Opening: Immediate, specific scenario
- Conflict: Current tool failure (call ignored)
- Resolution: WhyHi solution (context shown)
- Insight: Universal realization

**Platform Adaptations:**
- **LinkedIn:** Professional scenario (client needs answer before meeting)
- **Facebook:** Parent scenario (coordinating pickup)
- **Instagram:** Friend scenario (shorter, punchier)

---

### Formula 2: The Hidden Cost

**Structure:**
1. Name what we've normalized (texting instead of calling)
2. Reveal the hidden cost (what we're losing)
3. Show the contrast (what live conversation gives us)
4. Soft invitation (there's a better way)

**When to Use:**
- For problem awareness content
- When audience might not realize the issue
- For LinkedIn (professional relationship angle)
- When you want reflective, not action-oriented tone

**Example:**

"We've gotten really good at texting back and forth. Twenty messages just to schedule a 30-minute call. It feels efficient. But is it?

What we don't realize: those 20 texts took 45 minutes spread across two days. And we still don't feel any closer.

A 5-minute call would've scheduled the thing AND let us hear each other's voice. That's what we're actually missing.

There's a better way."

**Formula Elements:**
- Acknowledgment: We do this (validate behavior)
- Question: But what's the real cost?
- Contrast: What we could have instead
- Invitation: Not a command, an offer

**Platform Adaptations:**
- **LinkedIn:** Focus on professional time waste
- **Facebook:** Focus on emotional cost (missing connection)
- **Instagram:** Visual contrast (texts vs call duration)

---

### Formula 3: The Moment of Clarity

**Structure:**
1. Present the universal behavior (we all do this)
2. Ask the revealing question (why DO we do this?)
3. Name the real reason (it's not us, it's the design)
4. Show the alternative

**When to Use:**
- When addressing call avoidance directly
- For audiences who already experience the problem
- When you want "aha moment" impact
- For video content (talking head style)

**Example:**

"Why don't we call people anymore?

It's not because we're too busy. We spend hours texting. It's not because we don't want connection—we're lonelier than ever.

It's because phone calls are blind. You don't know why someone's calling or how long it'll take. So it feels risky. So we text instead.

But what if calls weren't blind? What if you saw '10 min · Connection' before you answered?

You'd pick up."

**Formula Elements:**
- Universal question (we've all wondered this)
- Rule out false answers (not busy, not antisocial)
- True answer (design problem, not personal failing)
- Simple solution reveal

**Platform Adaptations:**
- **LinkedIn:** Professional version (missed opportunities)
- **Facebook:** Personal version (lost friendships)
- **Instagram:** Quick version (faster pacing)

---

### Formula 4: The Problem People Don't Know They Have

**Structure:**
1. Name something we've accepted as normal
2. Peel back the layer (but wait, that's actually broken)
3. Show how obvious it becomes once named
4. Position WhyHi as the clear solution

**When to Use:**
- For problem education content
- When targeting people who don't yet know they have the problem
- For launching new messaging angles
- When you want to shift perception

**Example:**

"We accept that no one picks up the phone anymore. That's just how it is now, right?

But think about it: when's the last time you answered a call from a friend without hesitation? When's the last time you called someone without overthinking it?

Phone calls are broken. Not because we don't want connection—but because we have no idea what we're signing up for when we answer.

The moment someone shows you WHY they're calling and HOW LONG they need, everything changes. Suddenly, picking up feels reasonable again.

That's WhyHi."

**Formula Elements:**
- Acceptance: We've normalized this
- Question: But is it actually okay?
- Reframe: The problem is the system, not people
- Solution: Simple change, dramatic impact

**Platform Adaptations:**
- **LinkedIn:** Professional communication breakdown
- **Facebook:** Personal relationships suffering
- **Instagram:** Quick realization moment

---

---

## SECTION C: VOICE IN ACTION (Example Posts)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate Tom's voice through complete example posts. Content Drafter should reference these to match tone, style, and energy.

---

### Example 1: Use Case Spotlight (Instagram)

**Platform:** Instagram  
**Format:** Carousel (3 slides)  
**Use Case:** Locked out scenario  
**Formula:** Use Case Spotlight

**Caption:**

"You're about to walk into a meeting but you need one quick answer from your coworker. Do you:

A) Text and wait 20 minutes for a response  
B) Call and hope they're free

With WhyHi, you send a '5 min · Question' call. They see exactly what you need. They pick up. You get your answer. Meeting starts on time.

Once you experience this, you can't go back."

**Slide 1 Text:** "You need a quick answer"  
**Slide 2 Text:** "But you don't want to interrupt"  
**Slide 3 Text:** "'5 min · Question' changes everything"

**Why This Works:**
- Opens with relatable scenario (A/B choice)
- Shows friction (texting delay, call uncertainty)
- WhyHi solution feels natural, not forced
- Ending is aspirational without being sales-y
- Short, punchy, Instagram-appropriate length

---

### Example 2: The Hidden Cost (LinkedIn)

**Platform:** LinkedIn  
**Format:** Text post (no image)  
**Theme:** Professional relationships  
**Formula:** The Hidden Cost

**Post:**

"How many texts does it take to schedule a 30-minute call?

In my experience: about 20 messages spread across two days.

'When are you free?'  
'Tuesday or Thursday?'  
'Morning or afternoon?'  
'10am work?'  
'Actually can we do 11?'

We think texting is efficient. But is it?

A 5-minute call would've scheduled the thing AND given you a chance to actually connect. That's what we're missing.

Professional relationships suffer when all you do is message back and forth. There's a better way."

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with specific question (hooks attention)
- Real scenario (everyone has experienced this)
- Doesn't explain WhyHi explicitly (lets insight do the work)
- Professional tone but conversational
- Soft CTA ("there's a better way" not "download now")
- No emojis (LinkedIn appropriate)

---

### Example 3: The Moment of Clarity (Facebook)

**Platform:** Facebook  
**Format:** Text post  
**Theme:** Personal relationships  
**Formula:** The Moment of Clarity

**Post:**

"Why don't we call people anymore?

It's not that we're too busy. We spend hours texting.

It's not that we don't want connection. We're lonelier than ever.

It's because phone calls are blind. You don't know why someone's calling or how long it'll take. So it feels risky.

But what if you saw '10 min · Connection' before you answered?

You'd pick up. I would. We all would.

That's the idea behind WhyHi."

**Why This Works:**
- Universal question (we've all wondered this)
- Rules out false explanations (builds to real answer)
- "Blind calls" language (clear problem naming)
- Simple solution reveal (not feature dump)
- Inclusive language ("we all would")
- Ends with soft brand introduction
- Appropriate length for Facebook

---

### Example 4: Professional Use Case (LinkedIn)

**Platform:** LinkedIn  
**Format:** Text post  
**Theme:** WhyHi Pro / B2B  
**Formula:** Use Case Spotlight

**Post:**

"Your field tech needs to call a customer about a delayed appointment.

The customer sees an unknown number. Thinks: 'Spam? Bill collector? Do I have time for this?'

They don't pick up. Your tech leaves a voicemail. The customer calls back two hours later when your tech is at another job. Phone tag begins.

Now imagine: the customer sees 'ABC Plumbing: 5 min · Appointment Update' before their phone even rings.

They know exactly what it is. They pick up. Issue resolved in 2 minutes. Next appointment confirmed. Customer feels respected.

That's how WhyHi Pro turns missed calls into completed conversations.

Calling works—when people actually pick up."

**Why This Works:**
- B2B scenario (service business)
- Shows real cost (phone tag, lost time)
- WhyHi Pro solution is clear value (higher pickup rate)
- Professional tone with stakes
- Ends with memorable tagline
- Implies ROI without being salesy

---

### Example 5: Short Instagram Caption

**Platform:** Instagram  
**Format:** Single image post (person looking at phone)  
**Theme:** Connection  
**Formula:** Simple observation

**Caption:**

"When's the last time you called your best friend?

Not texted. Called.

Heard their voice. Laughed together. Felt close.

WhyHi makes calling feel easy again."

**Why This Works:**
- Opens with question (engagement)
- Distinction between texting and calling
- Emotional payoff (laughed, felt close)
- Direct but not pushy
- Short (Instagram sweet spot: 80-100 words)

---

## SECTION D: VIDEO SCRIPT FRAMEWORKS

**Purpose:** Templates for creating video scripts. Content Drafter uses these when approved idea is video format.

---

### Framework 1: Talking Head (Use Case)

**Length:** 30-60 seconds  
**Format:** Direct to camera, conversational  
**Best For:** Quick use case demonstrations, relatable scenarios

**Structure:**
1. **Hook (0-3 sec):** Relatable scenario, immediate grab
2. **Setup (4-15 sec):** Show the friction with current approach
3. **WhyHi Reveal (16-40 sec):** How it works differently (show phone if possible)
4. **Closer (41-60 sec):** "Once you see it, you can't unsee it" style insight

**Example Script: Locked Out Scenario**
```
[0-3s - Direct to camera, energetic]
"You're locked out. You need to call your friend for the spare key."

[4-15s - Expressive, showing frustration]
"But you know they're at work. They see your call and think, 'Do I have time for this?' They don't pick up. Now you're stuck outside."

[16-40s - Hold up phone, show WhyHi interface]
"With WhyHi, you send a 5-minute 'Question' call. They see exactly what you need before they answer. They pick up. You get the key. Done."

[41-60s - Back to direct eye contact]
"Once you know calls can work this way, going back feels insane."
```

**Storyboard Notes:**
- **Shot 1:** Talking head, medium close-up, casual setting (home/office)
- **Shot 2:** Optional B-roll of frustrated person at door (or stay on talking head)
- **Shot 3:** Close-up of phone showing "5 min · Question" on WhyHi interface
- **Shot 4:** Return to talking head, confident/satisfied expression
- **Text Overlay at 20s:** "5 min · Question" (sync with phone reveal)
- **End Screen:** WhyHi logo + "Try it free" (small, unobtrusive)

**Platform Adaptations:**

- **YouTube Short:** Keep at 60 seconds, can be slightly more explanatory
- **LinkedIn:** Keep professional examples, tone down hand gestures slightly

---

### Framework 2: Scenario Reenactment

**Length:** 45-90 seconds  
**Format:** Act out the scenario (can be solo with voiceover or simple acting)  
**Best For:** Showing before/after, emotional impact, visual storytelling

**Structure:**
1. **Old Way (0-25s):** Show frustration with current tools (texting, ignored calls)
2. **Transition (26-35s):** "But what if..." or "There's a better way..."
3. **WhyHi Way (36-70s):** Show relief, clarity, problem solved
4. **Reflection (71-90s):** Talking head wrap-up, "This is how calls should work"

**Example Script: Texting vs. Calling**
```
[0-25s - Acting/B-roll: Person texting, looking frustrated]
VOICEOVER: "When are you free?"
[Text bubble appears on screen: "When are you free?"]

VOICEOVER: "Tuesday or Thursday?"
[Another text bubble: "Tuesday or Thursday?"]

[Person sighs, puts phone down, exasperated]

VOICEOVER: "Twenty texts later, you're still trying to schedule one call."

[26-35s - Transition: Person picks up phone again, thoughtful look]
VOICEOVER: "Or... you could just send a 10-minute 'Planning' call and figure it out in real time."

[36-70s - Acting: Person initiates WhyHi call, show interface]
[Show phone screen: "10 min · Planning" ]
[Person smiles, speaks briefly (we don't hear audio, just see them talking)]
[Person hangs up, looks satisfied, gives thumbs up]

[71-90s - Switch to talking head]
"This is how calls should work. You know what you need, they know what they're signing up for. Done."
```

**Storyboard Notes:**
- **Scene 1:** Sitting at desk/table, phone in hand, texting animation overlays
- **Scene 2:** Put phone down, frustrated gesture (hand on forehead, etc.)
- **Scene 3:** Pick up phone again, open WhyHi app
- **Scene 4:** Screen recording of WhyHi interface setting intention + duration
- **Scene 5:** Act out brief call (can be silent or vague audio)
- **Scene 6:** Satisfied close (smile, nod, move on with day)
- **Scene 7:** Direct to camera for final insight
- **Graphics:** Text bubbles for texts, WhyHi interface overlay, arrow showing "before → after"

### Framework 3: Educational/Explainer

**Length:** 60-90 seconds  
**Format:** Screen recording + voiceover OR talking head with graphics

3. **Feature Demo (31-70s):** Show the app in action (screen recording)
4. **Call to Action (71-90s):** Try it yourself

**Example Script: How WhyHi Works**
```
[0-15s - Talking head OR voiceover over generic phone footage]
"Phone calls are broken. No one picks up because we don't know what we're signing up for."

[16-30s - Talking head continues OR transition to screen recording]
"WhyHi fixes this. Before you call, you set two things: how long you need, and why you're calling."

[31-70s - Screen recording of WhyHi app]
[Show: Opening app]
VOICEOVER: "Here's how it works. Open WhyHi, select your contact."

[Show: Selecting duration]
VOICEOVER: "Choose your call duration: 5, 10, 20, or 30 minutes."

[Show: Selecting intention]
VOICEOVER: "Choose your intention: Connection, Question, Planning, or Support."

[Show: Initiating call]
VOICEOVER: "When I call you, you see '10 min · Connection' before you answer. Now you know you have time. So you pick up."

[71-90s - Return to talking head OR end on app screen]
"That's it. Calls with context. Try it free."
[Show: WhyHi logo + download link]
```

**Storyboard Notes:**
- **Option A (Talking Head + Graphics):**

Before you call someone, you tell them why you're calling and how long you need. They see this before they answer."

[31-50s - Screen recording: Incoming call view]
"So instead of wondering 'Do I have time for this?' they know exactly what you need."

Let's get started."
```

**Visual Elements:**

Step 2: Choose your call duration: 5, 10, 20, or 30 minutes.

Step 3: Choose your intention: Connection, Question, Planning, or Support.

Step 4: Tap 'Call.'

Your friend sees your intention and duration before they pick up. If they can't talk now, they can tap 'Call back in 1 hour' and WhyHi will remind them both.

That's it. You just made your first intentional call."

[11-35s - Screen recording + phone SMS screenshot]
"When you call them, WhyHi does two things:

First, it sends them a text message that says '[Your name] is calling for 10 min to connect!'

Then, their phone rings like a normal call."

[36-50s - Talking head or illustration]
"They see the text, understand why you're calling, and they're way more likely to pick up.

After the call, they usually ask, 'Wait, how did you do that?' That's when you tell them about WhyHi."

[51-60s - Outro]
"Your calls become your best marketing. Next up: how to set call intentions and durations."
```

**Visual Elements:**
- Show SMS preview (actual text message format)

```
[0-10s - Talking head or screen recording]
"WhyHi has four call intentions:

Connection – catching up, checking in  
Question – need a quick answer  
Planning – coordinating schedules  
Support – someone needs to talk"

[11-30s - Continue]
"And four durations: 5, 10, 20, or 30 minutes.

Pick what feels right. If you're not sure, start with 10 minutes and Connection. You can always adjust."

[31-45s - Outro]
"The goal isn't to be perfect—it's to give the other person context so they can say yes.

Next: tips for getting your friends to download WhyHi."
```

[26-40s - Q2]
"Q: What if I need more than 30 minutes?  
A: You can extend the call once you're talking. The duration is just a starting agreement."

## SECTION F: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS

**Purpose:** Guidelines for posting in niche communities and reaching out to aligned organizations.

---

### SUBREDDIT POSTING GUIDELINES

**Approved Subreddits for WhyHi:**

**Consumer/Personal Use:**
- r/Telephobia (highest fit - entire sub is the problem)
- r/autism, r/AutisticAdults, r/AutismInWomen
- r/ADHD, r/adhdwomen
- r/socialanxiety
- r/socialskills
- r/introvert
- r/AskWomenOver30

---

### Universal Reddit Posting Rules

**DO:**
1. **Lead with the problem they already discuss**
   - Example: "I used to dread unexpected calls. Turns out, the problem wasn't me—it was the design."
   - NOT: "Check out my new app WhyHi!"

2. **Ask for feedback, don't hard-sell**
   - "I built this tool to help with [problem]. Would this help you?"
   - "Looking for beta testers who struggle with [pain point]."

3. **Be transparent about being the founder**
   - "Full disclosure: I made this because I had this exact problem."
   - Redditors respect honesty, hate stealth marketing

4. **Offer value before asking**
   - Share insight about the problem
   - Then mention WhyHi as one solution you built

5. **Use comment/DM for access**
   - "Comment 'BETA' and I'll DM you a link"
   - Keeps main post conversational, not promotional

**DON'T:**
1. Make medical/clinical claims ("reduces anxiety")
2. Post the same content across multiple subs in short time (looks like spam)
3. Argue with skeptics (respond once politely, then disengage)
4. Post without reading sub rules first (many have strict self-promo policies)
5. Delete and repost if first attempt flops (Reddit tracks this)

---

### Community-Specific Messaging Templates

#### r/Telephobia
**Lead:** "I used to avoid calls for weeks. Turns out, the uncertainty was the problem, not me."

**Frame:** Predictability tool, removes surprise element

**Avoid:** Clinical language ("cures phone anxiety")

**Example Post:**
```
Title: I fixed my phone anxiety by removing the one thing that made calls scary

I used to see an incoming call and immediately feel my chest tighten. Not because I don't like the person—because I had no idea what I was signing up for.

A 5-minute question? A 2-hour crisis? Was I interrupting their day by calling back?

I built WhyHi to solve this: before you call someone, you tell them how long you need and why you're calling. They see "10 min · Connection" before they answer.

Suddenly, picking up feels reasonable. You know what you're committing to.

I'm not saying it cures phone anxiety—it's not therapy. But for me, removing the uncertainty removed 90% of the dread.

Full disclosure: I'm the founder, building this because I needed it. Would this help anyone else here?
```

---

#### r/autism, r/AutisticAdults, r/AutismInWomen
**Lead:** "Phone calls felt impossible until I redesigned them as mini-agreements."

**Frame:** Boundary-first calling, reduces script uncertainty

**Avoid:** Othering language ("for people with autism"), focus on design not diagnosis

**Example Post:**
```
Title: How I made phone calls less overwhelming (by adding structure)

Unexpected phone calls were one of my worst nightmare scenarios. I never knew:
- Why they're calling
- How long it would take
- What script I was supposed to follow

So I'd either not answer, or answer and spend the whole call anxious about when I could end it.

I built WhyHi to add the structure I needed: before calling, you set intention + duration. The other person sees "15 min · Planning" before answering.

It's like a mini-agreement before the interaction starts. No surprises. Clear expectations.

Not a cure-all, but it's helped me actually stay in touch with people instead of avoiding calls for weeks.

Anyone else need this kind of structure to make communication manageable?

(Yes, I made this app—specifically for this problem.)
```

---

#### r/ADHD, r/adhdwomen
**Lead:** "I'd put off returning calls for days. Then I realized: I just needed to know how long they'd take."

**Frame:** Reduces activation energy, one-tap callback reminders

**Avoid:** "Fixes ADHD" (it doesn't), focus on executive function support

**Example Post:**
```
Title: The one change that made me actually return phone calls

My "call back [friend]" task would sit on my list for WEEKS because:
- What if they want to talk for an hour and I only have 10 minutes?
- What if they're calling about something heavy and I don't have the bandwidth?
- What if I call at a bad time and now I've wasted 20 minutes of anxiety?

I built WhyHi so calls come with context: "10 min · Question" or "20 min · Connection."

Now I know what I'm signing up for. The activation energy dropped from "impossible mountain" to "okay I can do 10 minutes."

Also: if I miss the call, one-tap "call back in 1 hour" sets a reminder for both of us.

Not saying it fixes ADHD (lol nothing does), but it removed the decision paralysis around phone calls.

Does anyone else have this exact problem?

(Built this for myself, figured others might need it too.)
```

---

#### r/socialanxiety
**Lead:** "Calls felt like ambushes. Turns out, they don't have to be."

**Frame:** Gentler, predictable interactions

**Avoid:** Medical/therapeutic claims

**Example Post:**
```
Title: What if phone calls weren't a surprise attack?

For years I thought I just "wasn't good at phone calls." Turns out, I'm fine at phone calls when I know what to expect.

The surprise is what kills me:
- Why are they calling?
- Do I have time for this?
- Is something wrong?

I made WhyHi so calls come with context BEFORE you answer. "5 min · Question" tells you everything you need to know.

It's not therapy. It's just... design that makes sense?

For me, it's the difference between avoiding calls for a week vs actually picking up.

Anyone else?

(Yes I made it, yes I'm biased, but I genuinely needed this to exist.)
```

---

#### r/socialskills
**Lead:** "How do you stay close to friends when everyone's busy? I tried this..."

**Frame:** Proactive connection tool, makes calling normal again

**Avoid:** Preaching ("you should call more")

**Example Post:**
```
Title: Making "just checking in" calls feel normal again

I noticed my close friendships were getting weaker because all we did was text. But calling felt like this big THING that required scheduling and reasons.

So I made WhyHi: before calling, you set a duration and intention. They see "10 min · Connection" before answering.

Suddenly it's not a big deal. They know:
- I'm not in crisis
- I'm not going to trap them in a 2-hour call
- I just want to catch up

And if they can't talk, they tap "call back later" and we both get reminded.

It's helped me actually stay in touch instead of letting months go by.

Has anyone else struggled with this? What's worked for you?

(Built this for myself, sharing in case it helps others.)
```

---

#### r/introvert
**Lead:** "I like connection. I hate surprise interactions. Here's what worked."

**Frame:** Saying yes to calls without losing your evening

**Avoid:** Stereotyping introverts as anti-social

**Example Post:**
```
Title: How to take calls without losing your whole evening to them

I want to stay close to people. I just can't handle surprise 2-hour phone calls when I only have 20 minutes of social energy left.

Made WhyHi so calls come with duration upfront: "15 min · Connection."

Now I can say yes because I know:
- It's not going to derail my evening
- I'm not trapped if it goes long (we agreed on 15 minutes)
- I can plan my energy around it

It's not about avoiding people—it's about knowing what I'm signing up for so I can actually show up.

Anyone else need this level of predictability?

(I'm the founder, built it for me first, sharing in case it resonates.)
```

---

#### r/AskWomenOver30
**Lead:** "Friendship maintenance is hard when everyone's busy. This helped."

**Frame:** Adult friendship upkeep, lightweight routine

**Avoid:** Mom guilt or "should" statements

**Example Post:**
```
Title: How I stopped letting friendships slip away

Between work, kids, life... I'd realize I hadn't talked to a close friend in 3 months. Not because I don't care—because calling felt like A THING.

Like I needed to set aside a whole evening. Or have a reason. Or wait for the perfect time.

I built WhyHi to make "just checking in" calls feel normal again: before calling, you set duration + intention. They see "10 min · Connection."

Now it's not a big commitment. It's 10 minutes between dinner and bedtime. Doable.

I've stayed closer to people this year than I have in the last five years combined.

Not saying it's magic—you still have to actually call. But it removed the friction that was stopping me.

Anyone else struggling with this? What's working for you?

(I made this because I needed it. Sharing in case others do too.)
```

---

#### r/LongDistance
**Lead:** "We kept trying to do regular calls. It never stuck. Then we tried this..."

**Frame:** Makes recurring connection easier, predictable routines

**Avoid:** Promising it solves relationship issues

**Example Post:**
```
Title: How we actually stuck to our daily call routine (after failing for months)

My partner and I tried doing daily calls. It lasted about a week before life got in the way.

The problem: one of us would call at a "bad time," the other felt guilty, we'd reschedule, then forget, then feel bad about forgetting...

Started using WhyHi: we both set "20 min · Connection" as our nightly routine. If one of us can't talk, they hit "call back in 1 hour" and we both get reminded.

It's been 6 weeks and we've only missed 3 calls (vs missing 5+ a week before).

The structure makes it feel like less pressure? Like we're both opting in, not one person imposing on the other.

Has anyone else struggled with this? What's worked for you?

(Made this app, but genuinely asking—what helps you stay connected?)
```

### Partnership Email Template

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: WhyHi + [Organization Name]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm Tom, founder of WhyHi—a calling app designed to make phone calls less anxiety-inducing and more accessible.

I'm reaching out because [Organization] and WhyHi share a mission: [specific alignment, e.g., "supporting the neurodivergent community" or "addressing the loneliness epidemic"].

What WhyHi Does:
WhyHi shows people *why* you're calling and *how long* you need before they answer. This simple change makes calls predictable, reduces overwhelm, and helps people stay connected.

Why This Matters for [Audience]:
[Specific pain point for their community, e.g., "Many autistic adults avoid calls because of the unpredictability. WhyHi removes that barrier by adding structure and boundaries to calling."]

Partnership Ideas:
- Beta access for your community
- Co-branded content (e.g., blog post or video about accessible communication)
- Feedback session to improve WhyHi for [specific needs]
- Webinar or workshop on intentional communication

Would you be open to a brief call to explore this? I'd love to learn how WhyHi could serve your community better.

Best,
Tom
Founder, WhyHi
[Email] | [WhyHi Website]
```

### LinkedIn Enterprise Outreach (WhyHi Pro)

**Target Roles:**
- Sales leaders, customer success directors
- Service business owners (plumbers, HVAC, real estate agents)
- Insurance agency owners
- Recruiting firm managers
- Healthcare practice managers

**LinkedIn DM Template:**
```
Hi [Name],

Saw your post about [pain point related to customer communication / pickup rates / relationship building].

Quick question: How often do your [sales reps / field techs / agents] leave voicemails that never get returned?

I built WhyHi Pro to solve this. It adds context to outbound calls—shows customers *why* you're calling and *how long* it'll take before they pick up.

Early customers are seeing 30-40% higher pickup rates.

Would it make sense to show you a quick demo?

Best,
Tom
```

---

## SECTION G: CONTENT CADENCE & SCHEDULING

**Purpose:** Define posting frequency, content mix, and pre-launch strategy.

---

### Posting Frequency

**Social Posts:** 3-4x per week (across LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram)
**Social Videos:** 1-2x per week (30-90 seconds, short-form)
**Instructional Videos:** One-time creation (7 videos for onboarding drip campaign)

---

### Pre-Launch Strategy

**Goal:** Build content library of 30 posts + 15 videos BEFORE mid-March launch

**Why:** 
- Content calendar populated through April
- Posting runs on autopilot post-launch
- Tom's time post-launch focused on users, not content creation

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks before launch (start early February)

---

### Content Mix Guidelines

**Social Posts (30 total):**
- **40% (12 posts):** Use Case Spotlights (relatable scenarios from Use Case Library)
- **30% (9 posts):** Hidden Cost / Moment of Clarity (problem awareness)
- **20% (6 posts):** Educational (how WhyHi works, features)
- **10% (3 posts):** Personal / Founder Story (authentic, vulnerable)

**Social Videos (15 total):**
- **50% (7-8 videos):** Use case reenactments (show problem + WhyHi solution)
- **30% (4-5 videos):** Talking head (observational insights, "moment of clarity" style)
- **20% (2-3 videos):** Educational (how to use WhyHi, screen recording demos)

---

### Platform Distribution

**LinkedIn:** 
- **Frequency:** 2x/week (Tuesday morning 9-10am, Thursday afternoon 2-3pm)

- **Tone:** Personal, relatable, punchy

---

### Scheduling Strategy

**Use Buffer for Automated Posting:**
- All approved posts scheduled in advance
- Mix of platforms and themes to avoid repetition
- Stagger posting times based on platform best practices
- Tom reviews calendar weekly but doesn't manually post

**Content Calendar Structure:**
- Week 1: Introduce problem (loneliness paradox, texting vs calling)
- Week 2: Show use cases (everyday logistics, quick questions)
- Week 3: Deepen problem awareness (hidden cost, call anxiety)
- Week 4: Demonstrate solution (how WhyHi works)
- Week 5+: Rotate through use case clusters, maintain variety

---

### Engagement Strategy

**Responding to Comments:**
- Tom responds to meaningful comments/questions within 24 hours
- COS does NOT auto-respond (keep human touch)
- Use comments to identify potential creator partnerships

**Tracking Performance:**
- COS pulls engagement metrics automatically (via engagement_tracking workflow)
- Weekly review: which themes/formats are resonating?
- Adjust future content mix based on data

---

### Content Refresh Cycle

**Monthly Review:**
- Which posts got highest engagement?
- Which use case clusters resonate most?

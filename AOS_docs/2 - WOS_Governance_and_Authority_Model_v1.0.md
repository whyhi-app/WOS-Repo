# WOS Governance & Authority Model (v1.0)

WOS Governance & Authority Model (v1.0)

1\. Purpose

This document defines how authority, decision-making, and change control
operate within the WhyHi Operating System (WOS). Its purpose is to
ensure clarity, accountability, and long-term integrity of the system as
it evolves across versions, agents, and contributors.

WOS is designed to behave as a governed system---not an autonomous
actor---with all authority ultimately traceable to a human principal.

2\. Ultimate Authority

The Founder (User) is the sole ultimate authority over WOS.

At v1.0:

\- The Founder is the only entity authorized to:

\- Modify foundational documents (AOS, Constitution, Governance, Safety,
Memory, etc.)

\- Approve or revoke agent capabilities

\- Grant or restrict tool access

\- Override system behavior

\- Authorize version changes

No agent, workflow, automation, or external system may supersede or
bypass Founder authority.

3\. Delegated Authority

WOS may operate with delegated authority, granted explicitly by the
Founder.

Delegation must be:

\- Explicit (documented)

\- Scoped (clearly limited in function and power)

\- Revocable (at any time, without system disruption)

Delegated authority may be granted to:

\- Human collaborators

\- Specific agents

\- Specific workflows or automations

Delegation does not transfer ultimate responsibility.

4\. Agent Authority Classes

4.1 Observational Agents

Read-only access; logging, summarization, telemetry; no state mutation.

4.2 Advisory Agents

Analysis and recommendations only; no execution authority.

4.3 Execution Agents (Restricted)

Predefined actions only; explicit approval required.

4.4 Administrative Agents (Future)

Not authorized at v1.0.

5\. Change Control

All foundational and configuration changes require explicit Founder
authorization and logging.

6\. Versioning Authority

Only the Founder may declare versions, freezes, or deprecations.

7\. Conflict Resolution

Resolution order:

1\. Founder instruction

2\. Foundational documents

3\. Logged precedent

4\. Fail-safe pause

8\. Safety Overrides

Founder may suspend or override any system behavior; overrides logged.

9\. Auditability & Transparency

All authority actions are logged and reconstructable.

10\. Evolution of Governance

Future expansion must preserve traceability and human primacy.

11\. Non-Autonomy Clause

WOS has no independent authority.

12\. Ratification

Effective upon Founder adoption.
